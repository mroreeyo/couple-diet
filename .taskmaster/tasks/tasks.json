Restored Deleted Custom Components\n- ✅ Restored src/components/auth/loading-spinner.tsx\n- ✅ Restored src/components/auth/form-input.tsx  \n- ✅ Restored src/components/auth/form-button.tsx\n- ✅ Restored src/components/auth/alert.tsx\n\n### 2. Reverted Modified Components to Original\n- ✅ LoginForm: Reverted to original custom component version\n- ✅ SignupForm: Reverted to original custom component version  \n- ✅ AuthGuard: Restored to original version using requireAuth prop\n- ✅ auth/index.ts: Restored all component exports\n\n### 3. Reverted Pages to Original\n- ✅ /login page: Restored to AuthGuard requireAuth={false} version\n- ✅ /signup page: Restored to AuthGuard requireAuth={false} version\n- ✅ /dashboard page: Restored to AuthGuard requireAuth={true} version\n\n### 4. Removed shadcn Related Elements\n- ✅ Deleted components.json configuration file\n- ✅ Completely removed src/components/ui/ folder\n- ✅ Uninstalled Radix UI packages (@radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-label, @radix-ui/react-separator, @radix-ui/react-slot, class-variance-authority)\n- ✅ Restored globals.css to its original simplified state\n\n### 5. Functionality Verification\n- ✅ Restarted development server to confirm functionality of restored code\n\nAll code has been successfully reverted to the state just before the introduction of shadcn, with all original elegant custom UI components fully restored and functioning correctly.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T12:50:54.268Z>",
